WARNING: This gem is still under development.


== Functionality

This gem processes http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] documents following
a template for generating UNECE International Standards.

The gem currently inherits from the https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-standoc[Metanorma-Standoc]
gem, and aligns closely to it. Refer to the ISO gem documentation
for guidance, including https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-iso/wiki/Guidance-for-authoring[the Authoring Guide].

The following outputs are generated.

* an XML representation of the document, intended as a document model for UNECE
International Standards.
* The XML representation is processed in turn to generate the following outputs
as end deliverable UNECE standard drafts.
** HTML
** Word

NOTE: http://asciimath.org[AsciiMathML] is to be used for mathematical formatting.
The gem uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciimath[Ruby AsciiMath parser],
which is syntactically stricter than the common MathJax processor;
if you do not get expected results, try bracketing terms your in AsciiMathML
expressions.

== Usage

The preferred way to invoke this gem is via the `metanorma` script:

[source,console]
----
$ metanorma --type unece a.adoc                   # output HTML and PDF
$ metanorma --type unece --extensions html a.adoc # output just HTML
$ metanorma --type unece --extensions pdf a.adoc  # output just PDF
$ metanorma --type unece --extensions xml a.adoc  # output UNECE XML
----

The gem translates the document into UNECE XML format, and then
validates its output against the UNECE XML document model; errors are
reported to console against the XML, and are intended for users to
check that they have provided all necessary components of the
document.

The gem then converts the XML into HTML and PDF.

////
The gem can also be invoked directly within asciidoctor, though this is deprecated:

[source,console]
----
$ asciidoctor -b unece -r 'metanorma-unece' a.adoc
----
////

== Installation

=== Quick start

https://www.metanorma.com/overview/getting-started/

=== macOS

If you are using macOS, the https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup
repository has instructions on setting up your machine to run Metanorma
scripts such as this one. You need only run the following in a Terminal console:

[source,console]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup/master/metanorma-setup)
$ gem install metanorma-unece
$ gem install metanorma-cli
----

=== Testing

Since this software is still in development it is not yet as mature as the other standards we support. We plan to fully complete support if there is interest.

The easiest way to try out is using a Mac. It takes a little bit more work on a Windows machine through the platform-independent Docker container (see the https://www.metanorma.com/overview/getting-started/#docker-setup[Metanorma Quickstart guide]) , but it is doable.

The current examples of UNECE documents encoded using Metanorma is provided in https://github.com/riboseinc/unece-docs/

(Please run the 2-line macOS setup script prior to the following)

First, use Git to clone the code and documents:

[source,console]
--
git clone https://github.com/riboseinc/unece-docs/
--

Then, install all dependencies with this command:

[source,console]
--
bundle
--

Next, run the compilation toolchain:

[source,console]
--
make all
--

Then you will see the files generated, including HTML and Word Doc. 
 
The easiest way to start a new document is to copy one of the two samples and modify them.



== Approach

=== Document model

The UNECE Standard Document model is an instance of the
https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-model-standoc[StandardDocument model].

The UNECE format ("UNECE XML") intends to introduce rigor into the UNECE
standards authoring process, and is prescribed in a separate document.

=== Asciidoctor

Asciidoctor has been selected as the authoring tool to generate the document
model representation of UNECE standards. It is a document formatting tool like
Markdown and DocBook, which combines the relative ease of use of the former
(using relatively lightweight markup), and the rigor and expressively of the
latter (it has a well-defined syntax, and was in fact initially developed as a
DocBook document authoring tool). Asciidoctor has built-in capability to output
Text, DocBook and HTML; so it can be used to preview the file as it is being
authored.

Generating documents via a document model substantially automated formatting
associated with the document, including automating numbering of headings, figures,
tables etc, and automatically generating references and citations.

== Document Attributes

=== Common attributes

The gem relies on Asciidoctor document attributes to provide necessary
metadata about the document. The https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-standoc[metanorma-standoc]
gem documents the Asciidoctor document attributes common to all metanorma gems. These include:

`:edition:`:: The document edition

`:revdate:`:: The date the document was last updated

`:copyright-year:`:: The year which will be claimed as when the copyright for
the document was issued

`:title:`:: The main component of the English title of the document
(mandatory). (The first line of the AsciiDoc document, which contains the title
introduced with `=`, is ignored)

`:doctype:`:: The document type (see _UNECE deliverables: The different types of
UNECE publications_) (mandatory). Note that the document types are reflected in the
document identifier. The permitted types for UNECE are:
+
--
recommendation:: UNECE Recommendation
plenary:: UNECE Plenary document
addendum:: Addendum
communication:: Communication
corrigendum:: Corrigendum
reissue:: Reissue (of something)
agenda:: Documents relating to agendas of principal organs
budgetary:: Documents relating to programme budget implications
sec-gen-notes:: Notes by the Secretary-General
expert-report:: Reports of intergovernmental and expert bodies
resolution:: Resolutions and other formal decisions of United Nations organs
--

`:status:``:: The document status. The permitted types are: `proposal`,
`working-draft`, `committee-draft`, `draft-standard`, `final-draft`,
`published`, `withdrawn`.

`:committee:`:: The name of the relevant UNECE committee, for example,
  `United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT)` (mandatory)

`:language:` :: The language(s) of the document. This is the language in which the document
has been issued, not the language(s) in which it has been submitted. ISO-639-1 codes are used
for languages, and they are comma-delimited. If not specified, the six official languages of the
UN are assumed: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish (`ar,zh,en,fr,ru,es`).
`:script:` :: The script of the document

`:toc:` :: Include table of contents in Word output. (Table of contents is always included in
HTML output.)

NOTE: The attribute `:draft:`, if present, includes review notes in the XML output;
these are otherwise suppressed.

=== UN document-specific attributes

`:distribution:`:: Extent of distribution allowed. e.g. `General`

=== Recommendation specific attributes

`:docnumber:`:: The document number if the document is a Recommendation. e.g. `42` for Recommendation 42, which happens to be the ultimate answer. (mandatory for Recommendation)

`:submissionlanguage:`:: The language(s) in which the document was originally submitted.
ISO-639-1 codes are used for languages, and they are comma-delimited. 

=== Plenary document specific attributes

`:session-date:`:: Date of the session where this document will be discussed. e.g. `Geneva, 30 April â€“ 1 May 2018`

`:item-number:`:: Number of the agenda item this document belongs to. e.g. `Item 6 of the provisional agenda`. If the document corresponds to multiple items, they are comma-delimited. If the document belongs to multiple subitems under a single item, following editorial practice of the UN (http://dd.dgacm.org/editorialmanual/ed-guidelines/format/Model_mast21.pdf), give the item and subitems identifiers here.

`:item-name:`:: Name of the agenda item this document belongs to. If the document corresponds to multiple items, they are comma-delimited. 
`:subitem-name:`:: Name of the agenda subitem this document belongs to. If the document corresponds to multiple subitems, they are comma-delimited. 

`:collaborator:`:: Collaborator of this document, if any. e.g. `World Economic Forum`

`:agenda-id:`:: The unique identifier of this agenda item. e.g. `ECE/TRADE/C/CEFACT/2018/6`. If there are multiple agenda items or subitems, given them comma-delimited.

`:item-footnote:`:: Footnoted reference to item, if item is on the preliminary list or the provisional agenda.

== Asciidoctor features specific to CSAND

The https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-standoc[metanorma-standoc]
gem documents the customisations of Asciidoctor markup common to all metanorma gems.
The following markup is specific to this gem:

=== Abstract

Abstracts are moved to the front page in plenary documents. In recommendation documents, they appear in the document preface, before the foreword and introduction.

=== Paragraph numbering

Paragraphs are automatically numbered in this gem, and paragraph numbers should not be entered in the Asciidoctor
source. Paragraphs are numbered by treating each paragraph in the Metanorma XML as a separate clause; all terminal
clauses in UNECE Metanorma XML are rendered as a numbered paragraph. Non-paragraph blocks (tables, figures, admonitions, 
lists) are not numbered; nor are paragraphs in prefatory material (introduction, foreword, abstract). 

=== Admonitions

The admonition container "IMPORTANT" is used to render UNECE document boxes. Unlike normal Metanorma admonitions,
UNECE admonitions can have titles:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[IMPORTANT]
.Business Process Analysis Plus (BPA+)   (<==== This is the box title)
====
Business Process Analysis was initially designed to document and evaluate an import/export process at a given point time and its relative simplicity. It also specifically includes a measurement of the time and cost of the complete range of procedures as one of the main outputs of the analysis. This combination makes it suitable as the basis/core of a trade facilitation monitoring and improvement system.

== Data Models

The UNECE Standard Document format is an instance of the
https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-model-standoc[StandardDocument model]. Details of
this general model can be found on its page.

Details of the UNECE modifications to this general model can be found in the
https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-model-unece[UNECE model]
repository.

== Examples

* link:spec/examples/plenary.adoc[] is the source file for the "`ECE/TRADE/C/CEFACT/2018/6`" plenary document.
* link:spec/examples/rec42.adoc[] is the source file for Recommendation 42.
* link:spec/examples/rfc6350.adoc[] is the UNECE version of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350[RFC 6350].
