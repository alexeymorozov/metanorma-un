WARNING: This gem is still under development.


== Functionality

This gem processes http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] documents following
a template for generating UNECE International Standards.

The gem currently inherits from the https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-standoc[Metanorma-Standoc]
gem, and aligns closely to it. Refer to the ISO gem documentation
for guidance, including https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-iso/wiki/Guidance-for-authoring[the Authoring Guide].

The following outputs are generated.

* (Optional) An HTML preview generated directly from the Asciidoctor document,
using native AsciiDoc formatting.
** http://asciimath.org[AsciiMathML] is to be used for mathematical formatting.
The gem uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciimath[Ruby AsciiMath parser],
which is syntactically stricter than the common MathJax processor;
if you do not get expected results, try bracketing terms your in AsciiMathML
expressions.

* an XML representation of the document, intended as a document model for UNECE
International Standards.

* The XML representation is processed in turn to generate the following outputs
as end deliverable UNECE standard drafts.
** HTML
** Word

This AsciiDoc syntax for writing UNECE standards is hereby named "AsciiUNECE".

== Usage

The preferred way to invoke this gem is via the `metanorma` script:

[source,console]
----
$ metanorma --type unece a.adoc                   # output HTML and PDF
$ metanorma --type unece --extensions html a.adoc # output just HTML
$ metanorma --type unece --extensions pdf a.adoc  # output just PDF
$ metanorma --type unece --extensions xml a.adoc  # output UNECE XML
----

The gem translates the document into UNECE XML format, and then
validates its output against the UNECE XML document model; errors are
reported to console against the XML, and are intended for users to
check that they have provided all necessary components of the
document.

The gem then converts the XML into HTML and PDF.

////
The gem can also be invoked directly within asciidoctor, though this is deprecated:

[source,console]
----
$ asciidoctor -b unece -r 'metanorma-unece' a.adoc
----
////

== Installation

=== Quick start

https://www.metanorma.com/overview/getting-started/

=== macOS

If you are using macOS, the https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup
repository has instructions on setting up your machine to run Metanorma
scripts such as this one. You need only run the following in a Terminal console:

[source,console]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup/master/metanorma-setup)
$ gem install metanorma-unece
----

=== PDF output

PDF output is generated by printing the HTML output as PDF. This is done
within the gem, using
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome[Headless Chrome],
via the https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer[Puppeteer] Node library.

To get the PDF output working, do the following:

* Install Node, with at least version 7.6.0: https://nodejs.org/en/download/,
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ . (For Mac, `brew install node`)
* Install npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node
* Install puppeteer: `npm install -g --save --save-exact puppeteer`

NOTE: The https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup script already
includes Puppeteer installation.


== Approach

=== Document model

The UNECE Standard Document model is an instance of the
https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-model-standoc[StandardDocument model].

The UNECE format ("UNECE XML") intends to introduce rigor into the UNECE
standards authoring process, and is prescribed in a separate document.

=== Asciidoctor

Asciidoctor has been selected as the authoring tool to generate the document
model representation of UNECE standards. It is a document formatting tool like
Markdown and DocBook, which combines the relative ease of use of the former
(using relatively lightweight markup), and the rigor and expressively of the
latter (it has a well-defined syntax, and was in fact initially developed as a
DocBook document authoring tool). Asciidoctor has built-in capability to output
Text, DocBook and HTML; so it can be used to preview the file as it is being
authored.

Generating documents via a document model substantially automated formatting
associated with the document, including automating numbering of headings, figures,
tables etc, and automatically generating references and citations.

== Document Attributes

=== Common attributes

The gem relies on Asciidoctor document attributes to provide necessary
metadata about the document. These include:

`:edition:`:: The document edition

`:revdate:`:: The date the document was last updated

`:copyright-year:`:: The year which will be claimed as when the copyright for
the document was issued

`:title:`:: The main component of the English title of the document
(mandatory). (The first line of the AsciiDoc document, which contains the title
introduced with `=`, is ignored)

`:doctype:`:: The document type (see _UNECE deliverables: The different types of
UNECE publications_) (mandatory). Note that the document types are reflected in the
document identifier. The permitted types are:
+
--
recommendation:: UNECE Recommendation
plenary:: UNECE Plenary document
--

`:status:``:: The document status. The permitted types are: `proposal`,
`working-draft`, `committee-draft`, `draft-standard`, `final-draft`,
`published`, `withdrawn`.

`:committee:`:: The name of the relevant UNECE committee, for example,
  `United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT)` (mandatory)

`:language:` :: The language of the document (only `en` for now)  (mandatory)
`:script:` :: The language of the document (only `Latn` for now)  (mandatory)

`:toc:` :: Include table of contents in Word output. (Table of contents is alwasys included in
HTML output.)

NOTE: The attribute `:draft:`, if present, includes review notes in the XML output;
these are otherwise suppressed.


=== Recommendation specific attributes

`:docnumber:`:: The document number if the document is a Recommendation. e.g. `42` for Recommendation 42, which happens to be the ultimate answer. (mandatory for Recommendation)


=== Plenary document specific attributes

`:session-date:`:: Date of the session where this document will be discussed. e.g. `Geneva, 30 April â€“ 1 May 2018`

`:agenda-item:`:: Number of the agenda item this document belongs to. e.g. `Item 6 of the provisional agenda`

`:collaborator:`:: Collaborator of this document, if any. e.g. `World Economic Forum`

`:agenda-id:`:: The unique ID number of this agenda item. e.g. `ECE/TRADE/C/CEFACT/2018/6`

`:distribution:`:: Extent of distribution allowed. e.g. `General`


== Data Models

The UNECE Standard Document format is an instance of the
https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-model-standoc[StandardDocument model]. Details of
this general model can be found on its page.

Details of the UNECE modifications to this general model can be found in the
https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-model-unece[UNECE model]
repository.

== Examples

* link:spec/examples/plenary.adoc[] is the source file for the "`ECE/TRADE/C/CEFACT/2018/6`" plenary document.
* link:spec/examples/rec42.adoc[] is the source file for Recommendation 42.
* link:spec/examples/rfc6350.adoc[] is the UNECE version of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350[RFC 6350].
